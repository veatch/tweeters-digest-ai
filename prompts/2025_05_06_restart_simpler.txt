$ What programming language and libraries are best for web scraping? I’m looking for something that installs and runs well in a docker container, and can handle modern websites that heavily use javascript to load content async 

For your specific requirements, I would recommend Python with Playwright because:
It handles JavaScript-heavy sites excellently
Has great Docker support
Provides a clean, modern API
Can handle multiple browser engines (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
Has built-in waiting mechanisms for async content
Excellent documentation and community support

$ Great! Yes, please generate a Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and simple Python script that uses Playwright to log in to Twitter. For now, let's use the simplest possible browser engine

I've created a basic setup for scraping Twitter using Playwright. Here's how to use it:
Copy the .env.example file to .env and fill in your Twitter credentials:

cp .env.example .env

Build and run the Docker container:

docker build -t twitter-scraper .
docker run -it --env-file .env twitter-scraper

A few important notes about the implementation:
The script uses Chromium as the browser engine, which is the most stable option.
The browser is launched in non-headless mode (headless=False) so you can see what's happening. For production, you should set this to True.
The script includes proper error handling and waits for elements to be visible before interacting with them.
Environment variables are used for credentials to keep them secure.
The script waits for 30 seconds after login so you can verify it worked (you can remove this in production).

Great! Yes, please generate a Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and simple Python script that uses Playwright to log in to Twitter

Key Features:

Headless Browser - Uses Playwright's Chromium to handle JavaScript-heavy content
Login Automation - Handles Twitter's login flow, including potential verification challenges
Cookie Persistence - Saves and reuses login cookies to minimize authentication requests
Error Handling - Takes screenshots at various points for debugging
Modern Selectors - Uses robust attribute-based selectors that resist UI changes
Containerization - Everything runs in an isolated Docker environment

The script will automatically handle login, save cookies for future sessions, and demonstrate basic timeline scraping functionality.
