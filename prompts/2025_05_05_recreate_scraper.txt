$ Please create a Python script which will use selenium to scrape recent tweets from a list of users. Then send the tweets via email. Create a Github Actions config file to run the script daily. Please also create a script for local testing.

TWITTER_USERS: Comma-separated list of Twitter usernames to monitor
EMAIL_SENDER: Your email address
EMAIL_PASSWORD: Your email password (for Gmail, use an App Password)
EMAIL_RECIPIENT: Recipient email address
SMTP_SERVER: SMTP server (defaults to Gmail)
SMTP_PORT: SMTP port (defaults to 587)
For local testing:
Apply to README.md
Run
py
For GitHub Actions:
Add the environment variables as secrets in your GitHub repository
The workflow will run daily at midnight UTC
You can also trigger it manually using the "workflow_dispatch" event
